This project is a text-based blackjack simulator designed to be played by 1 
player. This simulator is designed to run on a custom Raspberry Pi 4 kernel.
The player will have to play using a special controller.
(This version of the simulator is actually designed to run on Linux. The 
final edition will be designed for the custom kernel).
There are no known bugs with this simulator.

I tried to make this blackjack simulator follow casino rules as much as 
possible. However, every casino has it's own rules so I generally followed the
above link's rules except where I thought the rules were abnormal or I simply
didn't like them.

This edition of blackjack follows the webite's rules except:
	dealer always stands on 17-21
	players are always paid 2:1 upon winning
	if the player and house tie the player keeps their money
	you cannot double down after splitting
	no insurance or surrender
